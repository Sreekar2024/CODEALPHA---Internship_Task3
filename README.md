Handwritten Character Recognition 
ðŸ“Œ Internship Project - CODEALPHA

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Handwritten Character Recognition â€“ Building a deep learning model to recognize handwritten alphabets, characters, or even full words.
ðŸ“Œ Task: Handwritten Character Recognition
This part involves developing a deep learning model to recognize handwritten characters. The system can be extended to recognize full words or sentences.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features
Preprocessing handwritten images â€“ Noise removal, resizing, and normalization.
Deep Learning Model â€“ CNN-based architecture (such as LeNet, VGG, or custom models).
Dataset â€“ Using MNIST (for digits), EMNIST (for alphabets), or a custom dataset.
Evaluation Metrics â€“ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.
ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
Python (Google Colab)
Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib


ðŸ“Œ Features
About Me â€“ Introduction and background.
Projects Section â€“ Displaying previous and ongoing projects.
Resume Download â€“ Option to download the resume.
Contact Form â€“ For inquiries and networking.

ðŸ“Œ Expected Outcome
A deep learning handwritten character recognition model with high accuracy.
